Title: lists:map to recursion, fun_expr shadowing, multiple clauses
Goal: Eliminate HOF with recursion
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{hof_mode, recursive},{position,49}].
Documentation: lists:map used with fun_expr is transformed to
a recursion. The fun_expr has multiple clauses. One clause uses the
outside variable, while another shadows it.
