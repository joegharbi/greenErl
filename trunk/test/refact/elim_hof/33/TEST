Title: lists:filter to recursion, fun_expr multiple bodies
Goal: Eliminate HOF with recursion
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{hof_mode, recursive},{position,40}].
Documentation: lists:filter used with fun_expr is transformed to
a recursion. The fun_expr has only one clause and no outside variables
are used, but contains multiple statements.
