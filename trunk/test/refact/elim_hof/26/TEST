Title: lists:map to recursion, fun_expr unused outside vars
Goal: Eliminate HOF with recursion
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{hof_mode, recursive},{position,81}].
Documentation: lists:map used with fun_expr is transformed to
a recursion. The fun_expr has only one clause and outside variables
are used, but there are also unused outside variables.
