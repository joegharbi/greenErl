Title: lists:filter to recursion, fun_expr shadowing, one clause
Goal: Eliminate HOF with recursion
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{hof_mode, recursive},{position,54}].
Documentation: lists:filter used with fun_expr is transformed to
a recursion. The fun_expr has only one clause, and its parameter shadows an
outside variable.
