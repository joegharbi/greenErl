Title: lists:map to recursion, implicit fun, new fun name already exists
Goal: Eliminate HOF with recursion
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{hof_mode, recursive},{position,66}].
Documentation: lists:map used with implicit function is transformed to
a recursive function. The new function name already exists, so we have to choose
another one.
