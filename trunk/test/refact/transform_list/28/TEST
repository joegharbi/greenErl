Title: keystore with same complex key
Goal: create a map update expression
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{position,74}].
Documentation: lists:keystore/4 is used by providing the same key in both the
first and fourth argument, but this same key is a complex key,
thus we cannot determint if they really are the same. 
First key1 is removed, and then key2 is added to the map.
