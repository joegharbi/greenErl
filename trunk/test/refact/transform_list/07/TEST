Title: standalone keyfind with complex key
Goal: Using maps find to simulate keyfind behaviour
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{position,75}].
Documentation: First, bind the complex key to a new variable, so that it is only computet once.
Create the tuple that keyfind creates, from the result of maps:find.
Handle error case as well.
