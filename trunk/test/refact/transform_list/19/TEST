Title: transforming return value, keyfind complex key
Goal: simulate tuple behaviour of list
Parameters: [{file,"test.erl"},{position,138}].
Documentation: If the recursion returns the result of keyfind, 
we need to return the tuple that the keyfind would have returned, 
so that the calling side does not see the change in return value.
